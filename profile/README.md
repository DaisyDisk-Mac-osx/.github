## What is DaisyDisk for Mac?

DaisyDisk for Mac is a powerful and intuitive **disk space analyzer** that helps you visualize and manage your storage. It scans your drive and presents its contents as an interactive, colorful sunburst map, making it easy to see which files and folders are taking up the most space.

Instead of browsing through countless folders, you can quickly navigate the visual map to pinpoint large, unused, or duplicate files. This approach saves time and simplifies the cleanup process, allowing you to make informed decisions about what to delete or archive.

The application is designed specifically for **macOS**, ensuring seamless integration and smooth performance on all Apple computers, from MacBook Air to Mac Pro. It supports both Intel and Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3) architectures and is optimized for the latest macOS versions.

With its sleek interface and powerful analysis engine, DaisyDisk is an essential tool for anyone who needs to maintain a clean and efficient Mac. It is trusted by professionals and casual users alike for its reliability and ease of use.
